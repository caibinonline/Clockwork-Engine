			/*the vertexbuffer has to be bound first and the vertexarray where the pointers should be stored in has to be bound too|
			specifies how the data is stored in the currently bound vertexbuffer and how to access the data in the shaders by using the position that is saved in the currently bound vertexarray
			this is the version of the method where the offset and pos are automaticly calculated per method call for all vertexbuffers and reset when a new vertexbuffer is created with the constructor call | its important to call this method in order(first for the first attribute in the vertex(stored in the vertexbufferdata), then again for the second attribute and so on)
			you should first create all your needed vertexbuffers, then call the method n times to specify the pointers for one, or more vertexbuffers and then never edit this vertexarray again, because after the creation of another vertexbuffer the offset and the position of the last edited vertexarray with the vertexbuffers are lost, because they were reset
			@templateparam[type] the type of the data at the position/offset/attribute in the vertexbuffer | for example a 3d position has 3 floats, so the type is float, but if the next data in the vertexbuffer is a colour, you might wanna use unsigned chars for the colour value(and normalized true and) at the next position/offset/attribute of a vertex in the vertexbuffer  
			@param[dim] the dimension of each vertex attribute(1=vec1 to 4=vec4) for example 3d position is 3 | its the count of objects of the type that are saved at the position/offset/attribute in the vertexbuffer | maximum is vec4, so a mat4 in a vertexbuffer has to be connected as 4 vec4s
			@param[normalized] if the type value should be normalized to a floating point value from -1 to 1(for unsigned types from 0 to 1), so the shader can work with the data | if the date is already normalized pass in false
			@param[pos] the position in the vertexarray to access the vertexbuffer in the shaders | for example pos=0 access in shader with layout(location = 0)in ... | the first call starts at 0 and then it increments per call | the pos is a public static variable of the class vertexbuffer, so you can manually change it 
			@param[offset] the offset/distance in bytes where the attribute is stored per vertex | first attribute is 0, but then always add the other attributes together | the offset is a public static variable of the class vertexbuffer, so you can manually change it 
			@param[stride] the distance in bytes from one vertex attribute to the next vertex attribute from the same kind in the vertexbuffer | all attributes added up together to make up the size of one vertex in the vertexbuffer, so the stride is the size of one vertex | the stride can be left at 0 when the data in the vertexbuffer is tighly packed(just one attribute) for example one vertexbuffer for only positions, etc
			@param[instancing] when to update the content of a vertex attribute to the next element | 0 = per vertex(each time the vertex shader is called), 1 = per instance(each time a new instance/model is drawn with ibo.drawInstanced(10) for 10 instances of a model, 2 = per 2 instances, etc
			the default of instancing is 0(where the vertexbuffer is not an instanced array and stores data per vertex) and a value of 1 for the instancing means the current vbo is an instanced array and stores data per instance of the model
			the updating means when to process the next set of attributes in the vertexbuffer | for example position, colour are saved per vertex in vertexbuffer to form the model and instancing should be 0 | or modelmatrices are saved in the vertexbuffer to draw objects with diffrent transformations of the model and instancing should be 1 

			pos is in relation to the vertexarray and offset/stride are in relation to the vertexbuffer | pos and offset will be calculated per call of the method, so if you wanna use another vertexbuffer for the same vertexarray, you have to reset the offset, or use the other method

			for example you have a vertexbuffer with an array of data where you got per vertex first 3 floats for the position(normalized from -1 to 1) and then 3 floats from 0 to 1 for the rgb colour value
			you would first call this method with the type float and the vbo, the position 0(because its the first pointer in the vertexarray), the dimension 3(because 3 floats per position) and normalized false(because the positions are already normalized), the stride 24 because of the 3 floats for position and the 3 floats for colour(3*4+3*4 bytes), the offset 0 because its the first attribute per vertex
			then you would call this method again with the type float and the vbo, the position 1(because its the second pointer int the vertexarray), the dimension 3 again and normalized false again, because its also normalized, stride same as above and offset is now 12, because of the 3*4 bytes of the 3 floats for the position, because its the second attribute
			you can then access the position of the vertices as location 0 in the shader and the colour of the vertices as location 1 in the shader
			another good example would be an array of an own defined vertex class as data in the vertexbuffer, where the diffrent attributes of one vertex are stored(for example 3 floats for position and 4 unsigned chars for colour) | its almost the same as above, but you have to change the type to unsigned char for the second call for the colour vec4
			the benefits are that stride is simply sizeof(vertex) and the offset can also be calculated with offsetof(position.x) or offsetof(colour.r) when they are vec3/4 member of the vertex class | and you can also easily store attributes of diffrent types in the vertexbuffer*/
