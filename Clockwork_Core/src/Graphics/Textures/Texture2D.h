		texture coordinates are needed to tell each vertex of a model which part of the texture it corresponds to(called sampling) where the range of texture coords is from 0,0 at the bottom left to 1,1 at the top right corner of the image 
		so a 2d triangle with 3 vertices with the texture coordinates 0,0; 0.5,1 and 1,0 would have as a texture a triangle cut out of the image from the bottom left to the top middle to the bottom right corner of the image | texture coordinates are independent from position coordinates

			/*creates a texture2D object that represents the image and binds it, so another bind() call is unnecessary
			also sets the texture parameters for the texture object | here its a GL_TEXTURE_2D
			@param[textureRepeat] the behavior how to repeat the image when texture coordinates are outside the range of the image(0,0 to 1,1), for example 2,2 
			texture coordinates are needed to tell each vertex of a model which part of the texture it corresponds to(called sampling) where the range of texture coords is from 0,0 at the bottom left to 1,1 at the top right of the image 
			so a 2d triangle with 3 vertices with the texture coordinates 0,0; 0.5,1 and 1,0 would have as a texture a triangle cut out of the image from the bottom left to the top middle to the bottom right corner of the image | texture coordinates are independent from position coordinates
			GL_REPEAT=10497 normal repeat, GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT=33648 mirrors the image with each repeat, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE=33071 the edges of the image are streched outside the range, GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER=33069 border colour fills the space outside the range 
			you should use GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE when using a texture once for a model(not repeating it over and over again) and otherwise GL_REPEAT(with model texture coordinates outside the range of the texture 0 to 1) | you should also use GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE for transparent textures with an alpha channel
			because with GL_REPEAT the pixels on the borders of the image are linear mixed with each other and that will look bad when its not used with a repeating texture like a terrain
			@param[borderColour] the colour of the border for the parameter GL_CLAMP_TO_BOARDER as a vec4 of floats | the default is black(0,0,0,0)
			@param[textureFilterUpscale] how opengl chooses the pixels from an image when upscaling textures/images | large model/many texture coordinates, low resolution/little pixel
			texture coordinates do not depend on resolution but can be any floating point value and opengl figures out which texture pixel(textel) to map the texture coordinate to (texture coordinates can be between pixels and not exactly on one pixel) | so with large objects and low resolution textures texture filtering is important because the texture coordinates of the large model
			can be between 4 pixels of the low resolution image and opengl has to decide which pixel to show on the model | so there are more texture coordinates and they are more specific than the low pixels(for example 16 pixel image for a model with 100 vertices each with its own texture coordinate = many texture coordinates between pixels and not exacly on one pixel) 
			GL_NEAREST=9728 selects the whole pixel of the image which center is closest to the texture coordinate of the model for a for a blocked pattern where each pixel is clearly visible(8 bit look with sharp corners)
			GL_LINEAR=9729 mixes the colours of the nearest pixels depending on the distance to the texture coordinate of the model to a new output colour for a more realistic output with a smoother pattern where the individual pixels are less visible
			@param[textureFilterDownscale] how opengl chooses the pixels and how opengl chooses the right mipmap from an image when downscaling textures/images | small model/little texture coordinates, high resolution/many pixel
			Mipmaps are collections of texture images where each texture is twice as small as the previous one, so opengl can use the right mipmap texture that best suits the distance to the object and the size of the object | a smaller resolution on smaller objects is not noticeable and its good for performance
			so its good for a high resolution texture on a small object, or a far distant object(because objects with a bigger distance to the viewer are also automaticly smaller) and opengl can pick the right mipmap texture and therefor the right colours for each pixel
			mipmap levels can also be filtered like scaling textures/texture filtering
			GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST=9984 takes the nearest mipmap to mach the pixel size and chooses the nearest pixel like GL_NEAREST
			GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST=9985 takes the nearest mipmap to mach the pixel size and mixes the nearest pixels like GL_LINEAR
			GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR=9986 mixes the two closest mipmaps to the pixel size(linearly interpolates between the two mipmaps) and chooses the nearest pixel like GL_NEAREST
			GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR=9987 mixes the two closest mipmaps to the pixel size(linearly interpolates between the two mipmaps) and mixes the nearest pixel like GL_LINEAR*/
